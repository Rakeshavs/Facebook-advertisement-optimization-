# ðŸ“Š Ad Selection using Thompson Sampling (Multi-Armed Bandit)

This project implements the **Thompson Sampling** algorithm to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit problem for selecting the most effective advertisement out of multiple choices.

## ðŸš€ What is Thompson Sampling?

Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic algorithm used to solve the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. It selects ads based on the highest **beta distribution sample**, updating the probability after each reward feedback.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- âœ… **Thompson Sampling**
- (Optional: âœ… Upper Confidence Bound - UCB)

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `facebook ads  predicition using reinforcement learning.ipynb` - Main script for Thompson Sampling logic.
- `Facebookads.xlsx` - A dataset containing binary rewards (1 = click, 0 = no click) for different ads.


## ðŸ“ˆ How it works

1. The algorithm simulates a series of ad selections (like 10,000 rounds).
2. In each round:
   - It draws a random sample from a beta distribution for each ad.
   - Selects the ad with the highest sample.
   - Updates the success or failure count based on the reward received.
3. The total reward is tracked to evaluate effectiveness.
